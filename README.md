# Flower Classification with Transfer Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying flowers into different species using deep learning. We employ **transfer learning** with the **VGG16 model** and **multiclass classification** techniques to categorize flower species based on images.

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of the **ARTI502: Deep Learning** course. It aims to apply advanced deep learning techniques to real-world problems, such as image classification using transfer learning.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow**  
- **Keras**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Matplotlib**  

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **TensorFlow Flowers Dataset**, which contains images from various flower species including tulips, sunflowers, roses, daisies, and more. This dataset is ideal for training models for flower species classification.

## Approach
- We implemented and trained both a **baseline CNN model** and a **VGG16-based transfer learning model** to classify flower images.
- The models were evaluated based on key metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, and **F1-score**.
- Transfer learning, using a pretrained VGG16 model, was leveraged to enhance model performance, reduce training time, and improve generalization.
