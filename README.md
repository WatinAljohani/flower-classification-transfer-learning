# Flower Classification with Transfer Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying flowers into different species using deep learning. We use **transfer learning** with the **VGG16 model** and **multiclass classification** to categorize flower species based on images.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **TensorFlow Flowers Dataset**. It consists of images of various flower species including tulips, sunflowers, roses, and daisies.

## Approach
- We trained both a **baseline CNN model** and a **VGG16-based transfer learning model** to classify flower images.
- The models were evaluated based on **accuracy**, **precision**, and **F1-score**.

## Instructions to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the code to start training the models.
